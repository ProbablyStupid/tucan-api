# TUCaN API

(This page will be translated to German eventually - feel free to contribute)

## What is this?

This is an attempt at "reverse engineering" the TUCaN system of the TU-Darmstadt.

## How do I use it?

You can script automated tasks in python using the api.py file.
For instance, you can automatically download your schedule.
